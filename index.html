    <p>LOL LACEON WAS BANNED OFF POLYTORIA W. Basically on August 15th, a victim of his pitched an investigation and HE GOT BANNED LMAO. FINALLY, AFTER 2 HARD MONTHS, HE IS FINALLY BROUGHT TO JUSTICE LMAO</p>
	<h2>Laceon is a walking L [9th of August 2022]</h2>
    <p>Alright, so ever since my last video, a lot has happened. An almost 10-page forum thread of Laceon complaining of my videos, we reaching a consensus and removing my videos temporarily, an argument, and 8 Polytoria messages. 
        <br>
        As of yesterday, the 8th of August I considered the Laceon drama a dead drama. Unfortunately, today I have been disproven.
        <br>
        Let’s start from where we left last time.<br> 
        Laceon sent a privacy complaint to Youtube’s legal team. This is pretty petty and it worked to his disadvantage.
        <br>
        Laceon, frustrated that I didn’t take the videos out then made a thread, encouraging users to report me. I do not see why I would get terminated. I do not think these videos are bullying, they attempt to present only facts, and perhaps harassing the person exposing you isn’t that good of a look on your resume, innit?
        <br>
        The aftermath of this long thread was a message apologizing for his actions a few days later. This was not genuine, however. At the time I was scared as shit and took his suicidal bait. I privated my videos (had trouble with privating them due to his dumb privacy complaint).
        <br>
        Today, I have received some messages from a past victim of his asking him politely to stop replying to her threads/messages. It is understandable why that is the case considering he abused her in the past and asked her for nudes, otherwise known as child porn or csam content
        <br>
        Laceon replied by him insulting her saying how she could have ignored his reply etc, etc, etc. In that message, he also shows how he is confident he will get a staff position on polytoria. I hope this video shatters every hope of his as it is simply impossible due to his standing with the community
        <br>
        From the messages, we also learned that Laceon feels offended that x tried cutting him off, even though Laceon literally cut her off more times than I can count.
        <br>
        I am 100% sure Laceon will watch this video and try gaslighting and/or manipulating me into removing this and my past videos. I will not fold this time. By the way wouldn’t it be nice for your employer to know what you do? I am 100% sure they will be so happy. If you don’t want that to happen I urge you to stop harassing and abusing girls online. FzOrb out.

    <h2>Damage Controll [2nd of June 2022]</h2>
    <p>
        Hey all, FzORB here and damn, does Iaceon suck at damage controll.
        <br>
        2 days ago, right before I went to hit the sack I received a friend request from Iaceon. What I saw was him trying to gaslight me into making my first video private
        <br>
        “The mopaiv accusation made against me is false and I have proof that someone else made an impersonation account of me. I have proof of it you can even have the mopaiv staff track to see if I have any alt accounts per IP to prove to you it's false.”
         IPs are not reliable when tracking users. VPNs are a thing and your IP is dynamic, meaning it can be changed at any time. Every time you restart your router you are assigned a new IP. 
        <br>
        After arguing with him he said he had proof, but when I asked him for it he just said and I quote “I no longer have the proof anymore for it, it was on my old discord account in which I deleted because I was going to quit discord overall” This overall makes him more guilty considering that he lied to me to make me feel like I was in the wrong. 
        <br>
        Then he says that his Brick-Hill account was compromised. Yeah, that’s what I would also say if I sent child pornography on the Brick-Hill forums and was being held accountable.
        <br>
        Then 1 hour after I went to sleep he decided to try to save his ass again by telling me a bunch of shit he lied about. He had to invent a good story to make me believe it. He thinks I can’t see through bullshit. I do see through bullshit. Especially his bullshit.
        <br>
        When I confronted him on his bullshit story, he told me and I quote “please fuck off you are miserable to be around.”. He just described himself. I can see how Iaceon is going to strike down my video. Ok mr Steven Ray Schow, let’s see how tough you are mate!
        <br>
        Friendly reminder Iaceon, you dug your grave even deeper than you already did.
